[Verse 1: AKLO]
Gotta get it homie gotta move it, uh
If you gonna do it then hoka ni no tsugi, yuh
Everybody just talk nobody really do it
Nan nara yaru made shitoke yo himitsu ni
Dareka to kakunin nante fuyou
Jibun no jajji dake de break the walls
Do hade na fake yarou yori
Cool ni low ni prove them wrong

[Pre-Chorus: LEO]
I won't give it up, the fight in my life
'Cause my life is living for love
I won't give it up, fighting my life
Standing off and groove on time (Woo)

Going to relight your feelings
When times get too rough, ooh yeah
Night and day are fading
Going to relight your feelings
There's no time to explain

Oh, nothing is for real
That's how you makе me feel
I gotta beat this stomping on love
Ah, pick up my wasted time
God might understand
Nobody can hold me down

[Pre-Chorus: LEO]
I won't give it up, fighting my life
'Cause my life is living for love
I won't give it up, fighting in my life
Standing off and groove on time

[Chorus: LEO]
Tokyo prison
Going to relight your feelings
When times get too rough, ooh yeah
Night and day are blending
Going to relight your feelings
Light up every last one of them (Woo)
